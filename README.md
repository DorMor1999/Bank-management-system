# Bank-management-system
In this project, I developed a bank management system using the C programming language. The primary goal was to efficiently organize and manage information. To achieve this, I implemented two essential data structures: a Generic AVL tree and a Hash Table.

The Generic AVL tree serves as a versatile foundation for the system, allowing for rapid access to critical user information. By using a Generic structure, the code becomes more efficient and adaptable, capable of handling various data types seamlessly.

Alongside the AVL tree, the Hash Table plays a pivotal role in tracking all banking operations, facilitating the handling of various transactions effectively.

Every user has a personalized AVL tree containing their transactions, optimizing memory usage and providing swift access to their specific details.

Overall, the bank management system is designed to be user-friendly, high-performing, and well-organized, ensuring seamless handling of banking operations. The incorporation of a Generic AVL tree enhances the system's efficiency and versatility, making it capable of handling diverse data and further improving its overall functionality.
