# Bank-management-system
In this project, I have created a bank management system using the C programming language. The main goal was to efficiently organize and handle information. To achieve this, I used two important data structures: AVL tree and Hash Table.

The AVL tree helps manage user data, allowing quick access to essential information. The Hash Table is used to keep track of all banking operations, making it easier to handle various transactions.

Each user has a personalized AVL tree containing their transactions, which optimizes memory and provides fast access to their specific details.

Overall, the bank management system is user-friendly, high-performing, and well-organized, ensuring smooth handling of banking operations.
